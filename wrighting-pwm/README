For local test you need to enable port 8443 in tomcat see parent README for settings

To install / upgrade the dojo

This is needed to install dgrid used on the groups page

First install cpm
curl https://raw.github.com/kriszyp/cpm/master/install | CPM_INSTALL_LIB=~/lib CPM_INSTALL_BIN=~/bin sh

There's a problem with dojox which means that you need to:
apt-get install nodejs
create a ~/.cpm.conf file with CPM_USE_NODE=1

pwm 1.6.4 uses dojo 1.7.0 whereas these commands use the latest version

Create a temporary directory and change into it
cpm install dgrid
cpm install dijit
cpm install dojox

Now create a zip
zip -r dojo.zip *

Copy the dojo.zip to src/main/webapp/resources

You can now delete your temporary directory
